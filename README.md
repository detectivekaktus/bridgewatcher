# bridgewatcher

***WARNING! This project is in the early stage of development. Do not expect the final result to be the same as the state of the project you can see right now. Use this application at your risk, as it may be updated in unexpected ways.***

Bridgewatcher is intended to be a useful and functional discord bot that crushes the latest data that can be found using the [Albion Online Data Project API](https://www.albion-online-data.com/). With this data the bot should be able to examine the data and make calculations and predictions for:
1. Crafters. Crafters will be able to find out if making a certain equipment is profitable and where it is profitable.
2. Refiners. Refiners will be able to specify the amount of focus used when refining and so get the profit of doing this activity.
3. Traders. Traders should be able to ask the bot to send direct messages to users whenever the price of an item has reached one state or another.
4. And more!

The project doesn't have a central host, so anyone who wants to you the bot, should check if the creator's instance is currently running (`Bridgewatcher#7151`) or should host the bot themselves.

You can find and install the list of the requirements within the `requirements.txt` file.
